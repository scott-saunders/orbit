# Protocols

This folder contains two protocols that are needed to perform ORBIT. First, you need your strain of interest with helper plasmid. Once you have that you can make induced electrocompetent cells that can be used fresh or frozen for later use. Then you can perform ORBIT integrations with those cells along with a targeting oligo and an integrating plasmid.
