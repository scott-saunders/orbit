# Plasmids

This folder contains plasmid sequences for performing ORBIT genetics. These are genbank files that can be imported into benchling etc. Each file contains the essential annotations - resistance genes, ori, and ORBIT specific features.

Currently there are two helper plasmids and two integrating plasmids. 

* **pHelper_ec1_bxb1_gent** - helper plasmid with gentamicin resistance.
* **pHelper_ec1_bxb1_bla** - helper plasmid with ampicillin / carbenicillin resistance.
* **pIntegration_kan** - integrating plasmid with kanamycin resistance.
* **pIntegration_LCS_kan** - integrating plasmid with library cloning site (flanked by terminators) with kanamycin resistance.
